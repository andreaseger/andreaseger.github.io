            <h2>Test-Driven and Behavior-Driven Development for Web Applications</h2>
            <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Traditional software project often encounter problems of staying within the 
budget and fully satisfying the customer. Agile software development uses
lightweight methods trying to solve these problems. Furthermore it puts higher
priority on stable and maintainable software compared to a comprehensive
documentation.</p>
<p>Test-Driven development an agile development method which was introduces during
the creation of extreme programming. Tests are used to motivate the software
design and the functionality of the application. Because Test-Driven
development often was only to benefit from its resulting test suite Dan North
created in 2004 Behavior-Driven Development. Initially it was just to remove
the prominent position of the word „test“ but he later developed a full
test framework which allows developers to describe features in the domain
specific language of their customers and use them  directly as acceptance test
for the software. Today Behavior-Driven Development has evolved into an agile
development process of it's own.</p>
<p>Both methods build around repeating cycles in which small pieces of code are
developed in fast iterations. At the end of each cycle the newly created code
is refactored to remove code duplications or so called smelly code.</p>
<p>During the developed example project it became obvious that it is not enough
to just use the available methods without knowing how they are applied
correctly. Also the benefits of using either Test-Driven or Behavior-Driven
Development become bigger after some time when it becomes more obvious how
the design is supposed to be motivated by the tests. On the other hand it
became apparent that not every part of a typical web application can easily
be developed in a test first approach.</p>
